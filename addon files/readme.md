This addon is intended to be used for the 11th Arma unit. It loads the tanks at mission start
and any tanks of a specified classname during mission runtime with a pre-set tank shell loadout

It is intentionally simple to make bug testing easy and to act as a completely autonomous script

No need to save or load shell loadouts, as soon as the tank spawns the ammo will be set.
